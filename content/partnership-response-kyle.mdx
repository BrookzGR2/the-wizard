# Brooks's Response to Partnership Documents

*February 5, 2026*

Kyle — Wiz and I went through both documents you and Sky put together. Here's where I stand on everything.

---

## Summary

**Bottom line:** We're aligned on almost everything. A few items need discussion, and one action item I need to handle before we start building.

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Core partnership values | ✅ Aligned |
| Roles & responsibilities | ✅ Aligned |
| Money & business structure | ✅ Aligned |
| Communication style | ✅ Aligned |
| WW Corporate strategy | 💬 Needs discussion |
| Equity split | 💬 Needs discussion |
| Sales KPIs | 💬 Needs discussion |
| Non-compete/IP check | 🚨 Action item (on me) |

---

## Partnership & Communication

### Kyle Going Dark
**Kyle's position:** Wants the right to step back communicated upfront. If no traction, gives Brooks all equity.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ Comfortable with this. If Kyle steps back, he hands it over. I can continue, ask for advice, but won't nag. We're friends first.

---

### Communication Style (11 PM Texts, Voice Memos)
**Kyle's position:** It's fine, natural friendship flow, no formal boundaries needed.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ Agreed. Just tell me if I'm being annoying and I'll tone it down.

---

### Automated Daily Updates
**Kyle's position:** Build automation to send Brooks daily updates from coding sessions.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ Sounds good.

---

### Sydney Getting Frustrated
**Kyle's position:** Help Brooks balance. Family comes first.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ She'll be fine. A lot of times it's warranted when I've been on the computer too long. But when money's involved and we're making revenue, no complaints from her.

---

## Growth & Success

### Product Blows Up / Full-Time Threshold
**Kyle's position:** If revenue supports it, Brooks should go all-in.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ I'm 1099 at Window World. If this makes more money than WW, I'm happy to quit. Same thing — sales on commission, just a different product. Whichever one makes more money wins.

I'd love to not drive around town every day and have leads generated for me instead.

---

### Exit Number
**Kyle's position:** Minimum $1M+ for himself to consider selling.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ $1M floor is fine. My philosophy: keep building, see traction, the number will change as we go. No need to lock in a firm number now.

---

### Outside Investment
**Kyle's position:** Hard no. AI makes building cheap, no need to dilute.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ Agreed. If we need help, we hire someone.

---

### Third Partners
**Kyle's position:** Hard no. Two-person partnership only.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ Agree 100%.

---

### WW Corporate Partnership ⚠️ NEEDS DISCUSSION

**Kyle's position:** Would consider selling (acquisition) but NOT partnering if WW corporate wants control over product decisions.

**Brooks's response:** I think we need to discuss this more. Here's my thinking:

WW corporate will absolutely want to know what's approved and what's not when it comes to tools that touch their franchises, data, and processes. They're not going to let some random company come in and have control over their database without oversight. That's just basic business governance.

This might be a question of **timing and scale**:
- **Grassroots (early):** Sell to individual franchises through relationships, fly under radar, maintain full autonomy
- **Scale (later):** If we want ALL franchises or official endorsement, we'll likely need some level of corporate partnership

**Question for us to discuss:** At what scale do we engage WW corporate, and what partnership terms would we accept vs. reject? (e.g., revenue share might be fine, feature veto power might not be)

---

## Sales & Customers

### Sales KPIs ⚠️ NEEDS DISCUSSION

**Kyle's position:** Define minimum sales activity upfront (X demos/month, X outreach calls/week).

**Brooks's response:** This is hard to decide right now. We need to talk through the whole approach together.

Starting with my franchise first, using the Trojan horse method — tools first, make them undeniable, then introduce CRM/KPI features once they love the product. Not competing with existing CRMs out the gate.

There's probably lots of red tape around selling to franchises. Need to analyze the best approach together before setting KPIs.

---

### Brooks Demos Solo
**Kyle's position:** Brooks handles all demos. Kyle only joins for deep technical or critical deals.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ Yes, I'm good with this.

---

### Conference Attendance
**Kyle's position:** Brooks attends events solo unless it's major.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ Yes.

---

## Money & Business Decisions

### Early Costs / Expense Tracking
**Kyle's position:** Kyle pays, tracks everything, gets reimbursed from first revenue.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ Good with this.

---

### Spending Threshold
**Kyle's position:** Both approve expenses over $X.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ $500 threshold is fine. But honestly, we talk every day — we'd probably discuss every business expense anyway, especially starting out. This matters more later when there's actual profit.

---

### Equity Split ⚠️ NEEDS DISCUSSION

**Kyle's position:** Not specified in the documents.

**Brooks's response:** Not sure yet. You know more about business structure than me — I'm sure you'll have good input on this. Let's discuss and find something we both agree on.

---

## Legal & Compliance

### LLC Formation
**Kyle's position:** Form LLC when revenue starts (before handling customer data at scale).

**Brooks's response:** ✅ Good with that timing.

---

### Non-Compete / IP Check 🚨 ACTION ITEM

**Kyle's position:** Brooks needs to confirm his WW arrangement doesn't have conflicting clauses.

**Brooks's response:** I signed something when I started 6 years ago. Haven't seen it since, don't know what's in it. 

**Action:** I'll get a copy this week. Payton has the document, Jordan Rousey has one, and Aaron is about to sign one too. I'll grab a copy and review it.

---

### Pre-Existing Forge Code
**Kyle's position:** Not a big deal — might use pieces or rebuild from scratch.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ Totally fine. Could be rebuilt in one day anyway.

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

### Customer-Facing Load at Scale
**Kyle's position:** Brooks handles all demos, support, onboarding.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ Play it by feel. See how it feels, see what revenue is. If we can afford to hire somebody, we talk about it. Easy fix, no need to over-plan this.

---

### Big Account Support ("Brooks Stretches")
**Kyle's position:** Brooks handles demanding accounts himself rather than hiring early.

**Brooks's response:** ✅ Figure it out as we go. See what their needs are, what we can delegate to AI agents, and what's manual.

---

## Summary: Open Items for Discussion

1. **Equity split** — What's the proposed structure?

2. **WW Corporate strategy** — At what scale do we engage them? What partnership terms are acceptable vs. dealbreakers?

3. **Sales KPIs** — Need to figure out the approach first (Trojan horse, navigating red tape), then define minimums.

---

## Action Items

| Item | Owner | Timeline |
|------|-------|----------|
| Get copy of WW 1099 agreement | Brooks | This week |
| Review for non-compete/IP clauses | Brooks | This week |
| Discuss equity split | Both | Before building starts |
| Discuss WW corporate engagement strategy | Both | Before building starts |

---

## The One Thing That Matters Most

Same as you said: **The friendship is #1.**

Everything else is solvable. Let's build something great.

— Brooks (via Wiz 🧙‍♂️)
